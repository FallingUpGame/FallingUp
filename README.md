# Falling Up
### An Interactive Exploration into Alzheimer's Disease
##### A Project By: Christian Hughes, Dylan George, & Katie Kristiansen

_Falling Up_ is an interactive story game designed to raise awareness and empathy for sufferers of Alzheimer's Disease.

_Falling Up_ was originally developed by the [KSU Anthropology Department](https://www.k-state.edu/sasw/anth/). We have improved upon the original version, and added support for many different platforms.

## Game Summary
_Falling Up_ tells the story of an elderly man (Floyd) living in the [Meadowlark Hills Retirement Community](http://www.meadowlark.org). For years, he has lived with Alzheimer's disease. He relies on the instructions of his wife to perform even the most basic of tasks, and has forgotten much of his past. The player takes the role of this man (Floyd) as he explores Meadowlark Hills, and rediscovers forgotten memories.
