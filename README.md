# Falling Up ## An Interactive Exploration into Alzheimer's Disease ### A Project By: Christian Hughes, Dylan George, & Katie Kristiansen

## Game Summary
In 2015, a group of students in the Kansas State University Anthropology department set out to raise awareness for Alzheimer’s using interactive media. Despite having no prior experience, the team elected to develop a video game. The result of this venture is Falling Up, an interactive exploration into living with Alzheimer’s disease.

Falling Up tells the story of an elderly man living in the [Meadowlark Hills Retirement Community](http://www.meadowlark.org), who for years has lived with Alzheimer’s. He relies on the instructions of his wife to perform even the most basic of tasks, and has forgotten much of his past. Falling Up strives to generate empathy and understanding from the player — especially those players that have little prior experience with Alzheimer’s disease.

The product of the students’ work was full-featured, but technically flawed. Our development team has set out to make the game more stable, reliable, and full-featured. We've set out to port the game to many platforms (Mac, Windows PC, Android, Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift) despite an initial release that was on Windows PC only.
